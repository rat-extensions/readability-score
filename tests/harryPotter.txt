Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard,
but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age.
He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's,
and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face,
knobbly knees, black hair,
and bright green eyes.
He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose.
The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.
